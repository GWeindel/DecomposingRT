/markers : contains all markers output after EMG processing and associated code to extract info (MarkersTrialByTrial_NPSpeed.py) and merged dataframe (MRK_SAT = MRK_SAT_M2 + MRK_SAT_PhD + additional informations like Median Absolute Deviation, bloc, recoded participant... product of /Data/preprocessing.py)

	/markers/M2 : contains corrected EMG markers for experiment 1
	/markers/PhD : contains corrected EMG markers for experiment 2
	/MRK_MNE : contains unsegmented and uncorrected markers generated by EMG marking algorithm for exp 1 and 2 and code to extract info from these.
    These files are used in preprocessing.py to add RT to trials without response ('NR trials', caused by segmentation). File structure is the same as the parent directory /markers/
	
Merging.py = code for merging the two experiments, recoding participant.

Data used for analysis is directly produced by merging.py and moved to the ../Analysis/ folder

Disclaimer : raw EMG data (.bdf) is available upon request (gabriel.[first author name](at)gmail.com) due to file size constraints
